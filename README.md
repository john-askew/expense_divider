# Expenser Divider

 - Python

Hi I'm a novice developer interested in Python backend. I post this here, hoping to increase my line of learning. 

The project is about an expense divider for meetings of friends, with functions that make it versatile.

I would like to make it work on smartphones, so I'm open to adding new languages. 

Thanks for reading
